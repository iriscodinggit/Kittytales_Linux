✨ Game lore:

In the pastel realm of Kittytales, a land where the skies shimmer with gentle pinks and blues, lived a courageous and curious kitty named Scratch. Gifted with a magical coin pouch that grew with every coin he collected, Scratch embarked on a whimsical adventure, not to save the world, but to buy the ultimate, never-ending, self-cleaning litter box. Guided by the whispers of ancient spirits and the promise of pristine cleanliness, Scratch's quest led him through cotton candy forests, over marshmallow mountains, and beneath rainbow waterfalls. As he gathered each coin, Scratch's heart swelled with the vision of a spotless litter box, ensuring that his beloved pastel paradise—and his paws—would remain forever clean and fresh.
