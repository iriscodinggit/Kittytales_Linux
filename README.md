‚ú® Game lore:

In the pastel realm of Kittytales, a land where the skies shimmer with gentle pinks and blues, lived a courageous and curious kitty named Scratch. Gifted with a magical coin pouch that grew with every coin she collected, Scratch embarked on a whimsical adventure to restore harmony to her world. Long ago, a mischievous spirit had scattered enchanted coins across the vibrant landscapes of Kittytales, each coin holding a fragment of the world's once-unified heart. Guided by the whispers of ancient spirits, Scratch's quest led her through cotton candy forests, over marshmallow mountains, and beneath rainbow waterfalls, unraveling secrets and overcoming playful challenges. As she gathered each coin, Scratch's heart swelled with the hope of rekindling the light of Kittytales, ensuring that joy and peace would once again reign in her beloved pastel paradise.
